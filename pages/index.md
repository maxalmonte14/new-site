Hello there, I'm Max Almonte. Born in 1994 in a half-island in the middle of the Caribbean, I earn a living writing code — mostly websites. When I'm not wasting time playing video games or watching movies, I like to explore different creative avenues, like performing stand-up comedy or writing fiction, which I just recently started doing. You can read about my first 100 days of writing [here](blog/i-wrote-fiction-for-100-days-straight-and-heres-what-happened), and find my stories [here](page:blog/stories).

I believe social media to be a capitalist plot, thus I limit my online presence to [Mastodon](https://indiehackers.social/@maxalmonte14). Come say hi if you are on the Fediverse.

You can find my RSS feed [here](page:atom.xml).
