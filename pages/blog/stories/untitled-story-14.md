After months of waiting, planning, and hard work, the day was finally upon them; it was really happening, and they could not believe it. When the moon went into hiding and the sun took its place in the sky, their long-awaited day would have finally arrived.

His name is Nathan, 32 years old. Cyber security specialist. Born and raised in the projects, he worked hard to achieve his goals in life. “We don’t fear being born in the hood, we don’t fear living in the hood, what we fear is dying in the hood.” He used to say. 6’2” tall, dark skin, light-colored eyes. He doesn’t talk much, but is far from “the strong, silent type”, even a bit awkward maybe. Nevertheless, that doesn’t matter to her.

Christine, 28 years old. Biologist. Upper middle class. Her parents worked to the bone to leave poverty behind and give their daughter the best life they could. Quite the contrast from Nathan’s humble family. 5’7” tall, dark skin, big brown eyes. She’s quite the social butterfly and has her way with words. They couldn’t be more different, but he doesn’t care.

They have been dating for three years, and tomorrow they’re getting married. It has been a long way — and wait — but they’ve finally made it, and couldn’t be happier.

Except he has a secret. He’s been consumed by guilt all these years, and he cannot hide it any longer. Tomorrow, before the wedding takes place, he’ll break down.

And so it arrives, the happiest day of my life — Christine thought. She extends her hand to grab his cellphone and stops the alarm. It’s 7:30 in the morning, and there’s much to do before the late afternoon ceremony. Christine walks to the window and looks outside. The sun is shining strongly, and the summer breeze feels good on the skin. One couldn’t ask for more, she says to herself. A door knock interrupts her quiet time. “Are you awake?” The one knocking said. “Yes, come in, Mom,” Christine replied.

“How did you sleep, honey?”
“I slept very well, Mom.”
“Good. Now, we have to start moving, there’s plenty to do if we want everything to be— ”
“Mom, mom, mom. We talked about this. It’s my wedding, and I have everything under control. All I need you to do is be there.”
“You cannot tell me to stay out, you’re my little girl.”
“From today on, your little girl will be a married woman, Mom. Nathan and I will need our space, you know that.”
“But, you are my baby.”
“And my own woman too, OK? Now you go relax and I’ll take a shower.”

Christine relationship with her mother was complicated. She was an independent woman who excelled at everything she did. Her mother on the other hand was having trouble understanding that. She still saw it as a little girl who ran to her mother when scared. Whatever the case, Christine knew she had to put a stop to her mother’s meddling before she started controlling every aspect of her marriage.

Christine took a look at her phone hoping to find a new message from her soon to be husband, but there was none. She was hoping he was awake and brimming with excitement for their big day, but it would seem that was not the case. She paid no attention to it, it was still early in the morning. Maybe he couldn’t sleep last night and is only now getting some rest. — She thought — Better let him be.

She took a long, cold shower and returned to her room. A wedding ring will rest on my finger tonight. — She thought — I’ll be a married woman. She’d walk from one end of the room to the other. Looking at herself in the mirror, picking clothes from the closet, choosing what makeup she’ll wear. She moved with the grace of a ballerina and a big smile on her face.

Another knock on her door. “May I come in?” It was her father this time. “Please do,” Christine replied.

“My daughter, soon to be a married woman. How do you feel?” Her father asked.

Unlike her mother, Christine’s father was a sensible man. He knew her daughter could take care of herself and rarely meddle in her affairs. He trusted her.

“I’m fine, Dad. Don’t worry. I’m ready for this.” Christine replied.
“Oh, I know you are. You always make the right decision.”
“I try, Dad.”
“How is he?”
“I haven’t spoken with him today.”
“Maybe he’s still sleeping. He’s marrying you; if I were him, I’d be sleeping too.”
“Dad!”
“I kid, I kid.”

He paused for a moment and took a good look at Christine.

“After today, you’ll be a married woman. I’m proud of you.”
“Thanks, Dad, it means the world to me to have you in my corner.”
“And you always will. Now, let’s head downstairs and have breakfast, shall we?”
“Alright.”

Christine and her parents sat in the kitchen table and ate breakfast together. It could be the last time I get to do this — Christine thought — so I might as well make it a good memory.

Christine’s cellphone started ringing, it was Nathan calling her. She stood up from the table and took the call.

“Hi, husband,” Christine said.
“I need to talk to you. Got a minute?”

His tone, even for his quiet, mysterious persona, sounded serious.

“Sure, babe. What’s up?” Christine said.
“I’ve been wanting to tell you this since we started dating, but it got more and more complicated, and well, now we’re getting married.”
“OK…”
“You see, the thing is, I didn’t know how you would take it, and what you would do if you knew, and—”
“Babe, babe. It’s OK. You can tell me anything, I’ll be your wife. Whatever it is, I’ll understand.”
“OK. You see. The thing is…”
“Yes?”
“I actually have a kid.”

Christine stood there, silent, refusing to believe the words that came out of her fiancé's mouth.

“His name is Robin. He’s five years old. It all happened before I knew you. I didn’t even know I had a son until he was a year old. It’s a long story. I swear I’ll explain everything to you. Can I swing by your parents'?”

Christine hung up the phone.

“What did he say?” Christine’s mother asked.
“The wedding is off.”
