It was 7:00 PM on a Wednesday night, as every day, it was a matter of minutes before the little circle turned green and her status changed to online. Robert waited. It was a long day at work, but everything was OK now; he was in his happy place, no more piles of documents to go through or angry screams from his boss. It was just him and the glowing blue light of his laptop in a small city apartment, for now. His day will be better as soon as that little circle turned from gray to green. And at 7:12 PM, it finally did.

A notification sound resounded in the four walls of the dark apartment, it was a message from her. “Hi, Bobby!” It read.

“Hi, Marie.” Replied Robert. “You’re a little late today.” He added.

“I’m so sorry, babe. Had something important to do before getting on, today.” Read Marie’s next message.

“It’s OK, I’m just happy you’re here now.” Replied Robert, followed by a string of kiss and heart emojis.

“Oh, Bobby, you’re so sweet, you’re making me blush.” Read Marie. “Anyway, how was your day?” She continued.

“Y’know, same ol’ same ol’, just pushing papers at the office.” Replied Robert. “But one gotta do what one gotta do.” He continued.

“Oh, Bobby, you sound like such an important man. I can already picture you, with that muscular body of yours, in a well-fitted suit, walking to work, smiling. I bet you make women go crazy.” Wrote Marie, adding a blushed emoji.

“It’s not like that at all. I’m just a normal dude, haha.” Replied Robert.

“Can I ask you something, Bobby?” Said Marie. A blushed emoji followed the message.

“Anything you like.” Replied Robert.

“What are you wearing?” Read Marie’s message. A couple of seconds later, an emoji covering his face with both hands was sent by her.

The question took Robert by surprise. “Don’t wanna tell me?” Read Marie’s latest message, accompanied by a sad emoji.

“It’s not like that at all.” Replied Robert.

“Is it OK if I guess?” Wrote Marie, and before Robert could reply, she sent another message, “You’re wearing nothing but your underwear.” It read.

“How do you know that?” Asked Robert.

“I can see you, Bobby.” She replied.

“Oh, yeah?” Asked Robert.

“Yes. You’re sitting on the bed, with the laptop on top of your lap. And you’re wearing nothing but your white, Calvin Klein underwear.” She replied.

Robert looked down at the waistband of his underwear. It said Calvin Klein in black font.

“Wait, is my camera on?” Asked Robert.

“Your camera is not on, Bobby. I. Can. See you.” Wrote Marie.

“Oh, yeah?” Wrote Robert.

“I know who you are, Bobby. I know what you are. You are no hardworking office man. You have never known the grit of 9-5 men. You prey on the weak and feed from the poor. You thought I’d never know? I knew all along, Bobby. You’re a cop.” Wrote Marie, no emojis followed.

“The hell you’re talking about?” Asked Robert.

“Look through the window.” Wrote Marie.

“What is that supposed to mean?” Asked Robert.

“Look. Trough the fuckin’. Window.” She wrote.

“Fuck you, bitch, no bitch orders me around.” Wrote Robert, followed by a string of middle finger emojis.

A bullet came flying through Robert’s window, shattering it into pieces.

Robert ducked, and the laptop hit the floor. “Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. What was that thing? Fuck!” Said Robert while panting. A notification sound was heard. It was Marie. “Look through the windowwwwwwwww.” It read, accompanied by a string of musical note emojis.

Robert crawled to the window and slowly raised his head over the window frame. A small red dot appeared between his eyebrows, then a resounding sound. “BAM!” It read. The sound was a new message notification.

Robert threw himself on the floor while covering his head with both hands. Sweating, shaking, and gasping for air, “I gotta get outta here.” He thought.

A new message arrived “Don’t even think of running.” Read Marie’s message. “There’s a block of C4 glued to your door, I wouldn’t open it, if I was you.” She continued.

Robert crawled to the laptop, his pupils dilated after reading that, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.” He kept repeating to himself.

“What do you want? You want money? I can give you whatever you want.” Robert asked.

“The money you stole from kids in the ghetto after beating them half to death? Or maybe the one you get each month from letting drug kingpins poison that same youth with their crap? No, Bobby. I don’t want your tainted money, I already got everything I wanted from you.” Wrote Marie.

“Fuck you. Fuck you bitch. Fuck you.” Robert kept angrily typing.

“Fuck me? No, Bobby. Fuck. You.” Marie replied.

“I can’t say it was a pleasure to meet you, but it will certainly be one seeing you die.” She continued.

“Goodbye.” Her final message read.

The room got illuminated for a split second.
