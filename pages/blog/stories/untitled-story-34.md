A poster peeled off the wall and was carried by the wind. It swiftly fell to Peter’s feet. He picked it up. “Trans guns matter.” That’s what it said in bold letters. A transsexual flag in the background and a rifle at the bottom. “The National Rifle Association supports transgender citizens' rights to own and carry guns.” Was written under the rifle. “These nuts are gonna kill us all one day.” Peter looked at the poster in disbelief. “These nuts are gonna kill us all one day”.

Peter Norton was a respected politician for the Democratic Party. Majored in Law at Harvard, he was capable and well-respected among his peers. Rumors were that he was one of the favorites to be the official candidate for the 2058 election. However, he would have to take a stance in the current national crisis first.

In the year 2055, a bill to ban transgender citizens from owning firearms was introduced by the republican president, Michael Moose. The intended effect was the usual, to alienate yet another minority and gain popularity points with conservative sectors; the achieved effect, however, was nothing like they planned.

The proposed bill generated rejection not only by the liberal population but even by conservatives who thought going after people’s guns was one step too far. “I voted for President Moose, God bless him, but if any president can undermine people’s constitutional rights on a whim, then we are living under communism.” The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was the one right known to everyday conservatives. They knew that if they allowed the government to mess with that one right, they would be opening Pandora’s box. For the first time in twenty uninterrupted years of Republican government, things were slipping out of their hands.


The cellphone started buzzing and its screen illuminated the room. Peter swung his arm, trying to find the top of the night table without getting out of bed. He looked at the cellphone’s screen; it was an unregistered number, and yet, he had a very good idea of who might be calling.

“What is it?” Peter said.  
“Pete, it’s me, John.”  
“What time is it?”  
“Golden opportunity time, or 2:37 in the morning.”  
“For God’s sake. What do you want?”  
“Pete, Pete, hear me out, this is important.”  
“I’m listening.”  
“Listen, I got from a good source that there will be a trans/NRA manifestation tomorrow. This is our chance, Pete; you have to capitalize on this one.”  
“I told you. I support trans people, I don’t fuck with guns.”  
“Pete, listen, you are missing the forest for the trees. I’m not telling you to become a gun nut; I’m telling you to capitalize on a situation America has never seen before. You could be getting the conservative and liberal votes. Don’t let your principles rob you of this opportunity.”  
“This nation was built on the principles of great men, John, and you want me to betray that?”  
“All I’m saying is it’s a new date. The LGBTNRA crowd is discontent. We could use that, Pete. We could get the country back on the path of democracy. Can’t you see that?”  
“Yeah, we could, by making a pact with the devil. Then what? We could never get proper gun regulation. As soon as we brought the theme back, we would be branded as traitors and run out of office. Maybe for good this time.”  
“Look, Pete, I know it’s late. I’ll let you think about it, but you have to be smart about this. Tomorrow is your last chance to stand for these people; after that, they’ll see you at the polls.”  
“Right. Goodnight, John.”

The next morning, huge protests broke out across the country. In Philadelphia, New York, Texas, and Washington, people flooded the streets shouting slogans and carrying banners. LGBT members, NRA members, African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, young people, senior citizens, everyone united in peaceful protest.

Peter watched the live feed in horror. What are these people really protesting against? — he thought — Is this the result of twenty years of abuse and repression masked as good old democracy, or is it that America’s idolization of firearms has gone too far?

He picked up his cellphone and called John.

“Are you watching these?” He asked.  
“I told you this was going to happen.”  
“This came out of nowhere; I didn’t think it would be a national-level manifestation.”  
“Well, now you know. What are you gonna do?”  
“I’ll make a statement after things calm down. I don’t want to be a cause for escalation.”  
“You will? Yes, sir! You’re making the right decision, Pete. I’ll get you a spot with CNN.”  

Peter sat at his desk, pen and paper in hand. He wrote, “The recent protests across the country are a sign of the changing climate our country is going through. American citizens, be it members of the National Rifle Association or the LGBT community, all long for the same thing: democracy.” Peter stopped and put his pen down. Writing this crap won’t be easy — he thought.

That night, Peter appeared on CNN to make a statement on the recent protests.

“We have Mr. Peter Norton from the Democratic Party with us tonight, who has prepared a statement on the current events our nation has been through. Welcome, Mr. Norton.”  
“Thanks for having me.”  
“Mr. Norton, could you begin by telling us what your position on the current affair is?”

Fucking John, he threw me under the bus — Peter thought.

“Certainly. You see, I don’t see the array of issues that afflict our nation as black and white, in fact, in my statement, I go into detail of why that is.”  
“Right, Mr. Norton. Let’s hear the statement.”

Peter started reading.

“The recent protests across the country are a sign—”

He stopped.

“Mr. Norton, we cannot hear you. Apparently, we are experiencing technical issues.”  
“It’s all right. I just realized I don’t need this statement after all.”  
“Very well, Mr. Norton, please go ahead.”  
“America, this is Peter Norton who speaks to you. The Democratic Party has stayed silent for far too long. The recently passed bill prohibiting transgender citizens from owning and carrying firearms is unconstitutional and a tool to alienate a minority, yet again, in the name of conservative values. I talk for myself and not the Democratic Party. However, I believe in gun regulation and do not support groups that idolize weapons. I say it has been enough. Gun regulation is a necessity, but it will not start as a means of alienating the weak or the poor. I won’t play a part in the party’s agenda, and I will not side with the devil either. It’s time to wake up America; we are better than this.”

Peter stood up and left.

“Well, that was Mr. Peter Norton from the Democratic Party—” The host voice became faint as Peter left the studio.

Peter’s cellphone buzzed. It was John.

“What is it, John?”  
“I just wanted to congratulate you, Pete. You threw your career away.”  
“Yeah, I did. It was either that or push an agenda I don’t believe in.”  
“You always have to be the better man… Damn it.”  
“I guess I have. Listen, since I also threw your career away, why not keep up the fight? Together, I mean.”  
“Do I have any other choice?”  
“No, you don’t.”  
“Fucker.”  
“That’s the spirit. I’ll call you tomorrow; we have much work to do.”  
“Got it. Goodnight.”

THE END.
