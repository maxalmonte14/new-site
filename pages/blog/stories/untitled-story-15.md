July 26, 1995

Dear diary, my heart couldn’t be more ecstatic. Today, Jennifer and I are celebrating three months of moving in together. Could you believe that? I still remember the first day I saw her, jogging in the park; she was so radiant! Her long, brown hair jumped up and down as she jogged, and the way she smiled, even after running out of breath. I felt like melting! Thank God I found the courage to approach her, I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t.

My beloved Jennifer is quite the catch; she’s not only the most beautiful woman in the whole world, but the sweetest, too! I write jokes for her every day, and every time I tell her one, she says, “Oh, please, Howard, stop. You’re killing me.” And burst out in laughter. Her laugh is like the singing of a little bird, so melodic, I could listen to it all day. I wish I could.

Every day I make pancakes for her, breakfast is the most important meal of the day! She likes them fluffy and with tons of maple syrup. I put strawberries on the top for decoration; they make breakfast sweeter and cuter. Oh, and don’t forget a nice glass of orange juice; she has to stay hydrated!

You must think cooking for her is too much work, but I don’t care. The look on her face and her beautiful smile are all the reward I need.

The other day, we watched a horror movie, she was frightened, but I told her not to worry and hugged her. We stayed like that all night long; it was so romantic.

Sometimes I think about what I would do if somebody ever hurts her. If somebody ever thinks about hurting my precious Jennifer, I might…

But that’s not the point! We’re here to talk about our three months together, isn’t that great? Who would have thought that a guy like me would ever end up with a girl like her?

To celebrate, I’m thinking about cooking her a special dinner, no more pizza in front of the TV! She deserves more than that; she deserves the world. I’m thinking of something fancy, like lasagna. I already have most of the ingredients, but still have to go out to get meat.

I bought her a new dress! It’s the most beautiful summer dress I’ve ever seen. Her long legs will look fantastic in that dress.

I love how athletic she is. I may have to start going outside more, exercising myself. I don’t wanna lose her! So I'd better stay on top of my game.

I am quite the catch myself, if I may say so. Young, tall man, owns his own house, works from home. Anybody would take me in a heartbeat. But I don’t want anybody else, I only have eyes for Jennifer, I could never love another woman the way I love Jennifer.

Should I get her a new Walkman? The first time we met, she had a Walkman, it was a bright yellow one, beautiful device! But it broke. Bummer. Isn’t technology amazing? You can listen to the radio and even play cassettes on these little boxes. We have a radio at home, but we mostly listen to the news; we don’t want to bother the neighbors with loud music. She’s so considerate.

To tell you the truth, sometimes I feel I don’t deserve her, so pure, so innocent. Will she ever leave me? And even if she does, isn’t true love willing to set her free? I wonder. I’m just a man, madly in love, I don’t know about poetry.

I’m gonna get her a dozen roses for tonight. Full-bloomed roses, that is, nothing of that yet-to-bloom crap. I want it to be perfect. She deserves nothing but perfection. I may even play some quiet music tonight. Is Richard Marx still the bomb? I can’t keep up anymore.

You know? I don’t know what would have been of my life if I had never met Jennifer. I don’t know if I would still be here. Whatever the case, I’m glad I met her, and I hope we can be together forever.

Howard closed the diary and got out of bed. He stretched his hands and legs and cracked his neck. He stored the diary in the top right drawer of a worn-out oak desk and locked it with a key.

As it was getting dark, and Howard still had to prepare a special dinner for his beloved Jennifer, he looked in the closet for his best attire, eager to go out and get some meat.

He walked to the front door. The wood floor under his feet squeaked with each step. Grabbing the doorknob, Howard stopped and said to himself: “Silly me, I almost left the house without saying good-bye to my Jennifer. What’s wrong with me?” He let go of the doorknob and walked to the basement.

“Honey, you wouldn’t believe what I almost did. You see, I was about to go out without saying goodbye to you. Could you believe that? Oh, please forgive me, my love. What’s that, honey? You wanna say something? Let me help you.”

Howard removed the gag from her mouth.

“I… I forgive you…” Jennifer said.
“Oh, my cutie-pie, aren’t you the sweetest? I don’t deserve your love.”
“Now, please. Please, let me go.”
“We talked about this, Jennifer. This is our house.”
“I don’t know who Jennifer is, sir. My name is Amanda Jones. Just please—”
“How dare you!?” Howard said.

He started walking from one side of the room to the other, then he approached Amanda and started brandishing his finger.

“Hear me out, Jennifer, and hear me well.” Howard said, “I’m a very understanding man, but I’m growing tired of your damn bullshit! Now, I’m gonna gag you, I’m gonna go out for a while, you will behave, and when I come back we’re going to have a nice, damn, dinner.”

Amanda kept begging Howard, “Please, please, please, sir. Please, don’t do this, sir. I don’t know who this Jennifer is. My name is—” Howard slapped her before she could finish the sentence. He then got on top of her and started punching her face while repeating “Your… Damn… Name… Is… Jennifer… Got it? Got it? Got it?” He stopped after his hand started hurting.

Amanda lied there, in a puddle of her own blood, unconscious, tied to a water heater.

Howard gagged her again, and started climbing the basement stairs. He stopped midday, looked at Amanda, and then said: I’ll be right back, my love, gonna cook you a special dinner.
