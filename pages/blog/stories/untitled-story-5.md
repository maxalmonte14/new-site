He opened the glass door and entered the small waiting room, the door closing behind him. Scanning the room from left to right, he could see an abstract painting he could not make heads or tails of, splashed with vibrant colors: crimson red, dark blue, lemon yellow, and obtuse geometry. His eyes kept panning to the right and fixated on the reception desk. He approached it with the calm demeanor that characterized him.

“Good afternoon, sir. How may I help you?” Said the young woman at the reception desk.

“I’m here to see Doctor Smith.” He replied.

“Perfect. Could you please tell me your name, sir?” Asked the receptionist.

“That’d be Scott Francis.” He said. “Can you tell me yours?” He added while smiling.

She paused for a second, as if caught off guard by the question. “Melanie Pryde.” She said with a smile while pointing at the nameplate on her desk.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Said Scott. “Likewise,” Said Melanie. “Are you coming for the first time?” Added Melanie, now in a more relaxed tone. “Yes, I am.” Said Scott. “Please fill out this form, then. You can take a seat and come back after you’re done. There are four other people in front of you.” Said Melanie while handing Scott the form and a pen.

Scott scanned the room from left to right once more. It was a small waiting room, and most seats were occupied. I guess I’ll sit near the water cooler, next to that lady, Scott thought, while slowly walking in her direction.

“Good afternoon.” Said Scott to the young lady after sitting by her side, she did not respond, but Scott was unbothered by it. Pen in hand, Scott said to himself, Let’s do this, and started filling out the form. Name, this one I know, he thought, letting out a small chuckle.

“First time here, huh?” Said the lady sitting next to him.

“Excuse me?” Replied Scott, who was absorbed by the form.

“The form. It’s for first timers. You haven’t seen the doctor before. Right?” She added.

“Uh, yes, that is correct.” Replied Scott, while stopping his writing momentarily.

“You’ll like, he’s good at his stuff, I’ve been coming here for years now.” She said in a confident tone.

“Did you just say years? He cannot be that good if you still have to come after years of seeing him.” Said Scott in a cynical tone.

“That’s one way of seeing things, I guess.” She replied, unbothered by Scott's comment.

Scott did not say anything more and got back to filling out the form.

“So, you’re thirty-five.” Said the woman sitting next to him.

“Excuse me?” Scott replied with a puzzled look on his face.

“Thirty-five. That’s what you put in the form. Age, thirty-five.” She said with a smile.

“Excuse me, lady, but this is private information. Would you mind?” Said Scott, being visibly annoyed this time.

“Alright. No problem. I just thought, you know, it’s just your age. No big deal.” She said.

Scott said nothing and got back to filling the form, now shielding it from the eyes of his annoying companion with his left hand.

“You know, I would never have struck up a conversation with you if this were a dentist's office.” She said.

Scott tried to ignore her, but the premise of her affirmation made him curious. “And why is that?” He said in a curious, yet annoyed tone.

“You may have had bad breath.” She replied.

“I would not have bad breath!” Shouted Scott while standing from his seat. Everybody turned their head to him, before he slowly sat again, with a little shame on his face.

“Then why are you at a dentist’s office?” She asked.

“I’m not at a dentist's office.” Scott angrily replied.

“But you would, in a hypothetical case.” She added.

“You know what? I don’t wanna talk to you. I just want to fill out this form, wait for the doctor, and get on with my day, OK?” An annoyed Scott said.

“Alright, alright. Jeez. Relax.” She calmly said.

It hadn’t been even thirty seconds when she turned to him and asked, “So, do you wanna grab a coffee after this?”

“Excuse me?” Said Scott in total disbelief.

“A coffee. My treat.” She said with a big smile.

“And why would I do that?” Said Scott while frowning.

“No reason. To be polite? I guess…” She replied with a nervous chuckle.

“Look, lady. I don’t even know you.” Said Scott, still frowning.

“Sure, you do. You know my name, I know yours. Scott, thirty-five.” She said while giggling.

“I don’t know your name. And stop being fixated on my age, it’s annoying.” Said Scott.

“Oh. I see.” She said with a little sadness in her voice.

Scott put his head down and continued filling out the form when she interrupted, “I’m Jess, by the way.”
