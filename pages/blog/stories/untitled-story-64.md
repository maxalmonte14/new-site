Frederick stood in front of the store, “Italian haute couture” read the storefront sign. Beautifully-crafted suits adorned the display window. Black, navy blue, burgundy, and olive green were the colors that could be seen from the sidewalk. Frederick took a step towards the window and stood on the tip of his toes; he was suddenly taller, and his head aligned with that of the mannequin. Looking through the display window was as if he were wearing the suit. “Navy blue, the color of success.” He said while his toes demanded that he release the tension put on them. Frederick’s attire was more casual; he wore dress shirts, chinos, and sneakers. As his soles touched the pavement, a smile drew on his face. He gave the window display a last look and left.

Frederick’s ambition went beyond wearing an expensive suit; he could easily afford one with his salary, but he aspired to climb to the top, to have the prestige of an executive role. He wanted people to call him sir and open the door for him. He didn’t dream of this for the sake of it; he arrived at work first and left last every day. In 10 years, he went from intern to junior developer, senior developer, manager, and finally architect; he was running out of promotions. Only the top remained, and reaching it was not mere illusion. It was rumored that the CTO planned to retire at the end of the year; the seat will be open, and Frederick will be ready to occupy it.

Two months later, four of the best employees were summoned to the CEO’s office, Frederick was among them. It was a dark office at the top of the building. For whatever reason, the top floors were barely illuminated and lacked the activity of the lower floors. Many offices were empty, and the few people who could be seen working looked pale and tired, with black eye bags decorating their faces. This mattered little to Frederick, who saw an office on the top floor as a sign of status.

The four men waited outside the CEO’s office. Frederick sat with his back straight and his hands folded over his lap; he looked calm. He was certain of the motive for the summoning, as were the other men. Frederick suddenly felt conscious of his attire; the sudden call didn’t leave him time to prepare. The secretary called the men in. She was a young woman with pale skin and under six feet tall. “She looks impeccable!” Frederick thought, noting her blue blazer with golden buttons and below-the-knee skirt.

The four men entered the CEO’s office. It was dark and cold, as usual. The CEO, Edward Smith, sat at his desk and appeared to be reading something on the computer when Frederick and the rest entered. “Good morning, gentlemen. Please sit down.” He said. The men complied.

“We’re all busy, so I’ll cut to the chase,” the CEO said, “as you may or may not know, our current CTO is planning to retire at the end of the year. This was supposed to be secret information, but we cannot impede people from gossiping; thus, the information filtered out. Finding the right fit for the position is of the utmost importance to us, and that’s where you four enter. You have been selected because of your immaculate record and the loyalty you have shown to the company during all these years. That being said, the position is but one, and yet, four of you are here in front of me. Being the CTO comes with not only an office on the top floor, but with a big responsibility as well. You will work 18 hours every day, no less. The failure of the team will be your failure. Always.”

The CEO paused as if to let the men process what he had just told them. They looked attentively, waiting for the next words to come out of his mouth.

“If any of you don’t want the responsibility that comes with the job, that’s OK. Otherwise, please stand up.” The CEO said.

As soon as the CEO said that, a man stood up; it was Julian Zander, the top security engineer in the company. Frederick stood up too. The other two men remained seated.

“I see initiative here.” The CEO said while looking at Julian.

Those words felt like a punch to the stomach to Frederick; he lowered his guard for an instant, and his career started crumbling in front of his eyes.

“That will be all, gentlemen. Please start working on your proposals to improve company efficiency by 10% during your first year. Thanks for your time.”

The CEO stood up and shook the hands of the four men. His hands were as cold as the room. Frederick felt a shiver.

Frederick started working on his proposals immediately; he knew Julian was doing the same, thus every minute was crucial.

The next day, Frederick and Julian were contacted by the CEO’s secretary. They were to undergo blood tests that same day as part of the background check for the selection process. They took half a liter from each man, not only for testing purposes but also in case they needed an emergency transfusion in the future.

Four months would have to pass before they were summoned to the CEO’s office again; by that time, they had both submitted their proposals and were ready to defend them.

Sitting in front of the CEO’s desk, Frederick refused to believe the crushing news. He didn’t get the job.

“After revising both proposals, I find myself forced to reject both. You both did a great job, but your technical qualifications betrayed you. An outside candidate’s proposal increases company efficiency by 25%; therefore, I feel obliged to hire him instead. I hope we can still count on your hard work, which, in time, will be properly rewarded.” The CEO said.

He stood up and shook both men's hands.

As Frederick left the office, his cellphone vibrated; it was new mail, nothing important. As the screen turned off, Frederick saw the reflection of the CEO in it. He could not see his body. It was only an empty suit.
